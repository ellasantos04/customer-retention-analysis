# customer-retention-analysis
Analyzing customer behavior to identify key drivers of churn and provide data-driven recommendations to improve retention. 

## Overview
Customer churn poses a significant challenge for subscription-based companies, and acquiring new customers is often more costly than retaining existing ones. This project analyzes customer behavior data to identify key drivers of churn and provide data-driven recommendations to improve retention.

## Business Question
What factors most strongly predict customer churn, and how can a company intervene early to retain high-risk customers?

## Dataset
This project uses a publicly available telecommunications customer dataset containing demographic, service usage, contract, and billing information.

## Project Status
🚧 In Progress — currently exploring data and performing exploratory analysis.
